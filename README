This repository contains my PKGBUILDS for the Arch User Repository.

This is just a small help for me:
makepkg -g --> generate md5sum
makepkg --source --> generate source package
makepkg -c --> build package and clean everything up after building the package is finished
makepkg -i --> install the package

My AUR-Packages: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&K=sh4nks
